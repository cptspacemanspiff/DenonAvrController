# Denon AVR Control

A simple MacOS appmenu bar app to control Denon AVR receivers. Specifically a 3313CI Reciever with ~2011 firmware.

## Features
- Power On/Off
- Mute/Unmute
- Volume Control
- IP Address Configuration

If you are unsure if your Denon AVR is supported, check the debug file that commandline controls to send to the reciever. I pulled them from the javascript in the web interface.
