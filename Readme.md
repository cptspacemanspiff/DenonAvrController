# Denon AVR Control

A simple MacOS appmenu bar app to control A Denon AVR receiver, Specifically a 3313CI Reciever with ~2011 firmware.

Mostly just wanted to learn xcode and swift, and spend a few hours vibecoding.

## Features
- Power On/Off
- Mute/Unmute
- Volume Control
- IP Address Configuration

If you are unsure if your Denon AVR is supported, check the debug folder, there are commandline controls to send to the reciever. These were pulled them from the javascript in the web interface.
